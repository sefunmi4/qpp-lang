# C++ Foundations of Q++

Q++ builds directly on top of modern C++. The goal is to reuse familiar syntax and tooling while layering quantum features on demand. Most existing C++ code should compile with a Q++ compiler, but new keywords like `qstruct` and probabilistic boolean operations add expressive power where quantum memory is involved.
