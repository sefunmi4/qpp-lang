# Why Q++?

Q++ is designed to feel familiar to C++ developers while enabling quantum-classical hybrid programming. Traditional C++ excels at systems programming but lacks native constructs for probabilistic execution and quantum memory. Q++ extends the language with minimal syntax so developers can:

- Declare tasks that target CPUs or QPUs using `task<>`.
- Allocate `qregister` memory for qubits alongside classical registers.
- Propagate probabilistic behavior automatically through conditionals and boolean expressions.

By keeping the learning curve small, Q++ lowers the barrier to experimenting with quantum algorithms and building applications that mix classical and quantum routines.
