Q++ Runtime Specification

⚙️ Overview

The Q++ runtime layer is responsible for executing hybrid classical-quantum programs compiled from Q++ source code. It manages task scheduling, quantum-classical bit resolution, deferred execution of probabilistic scopes, measurement collapse, and device targeting (QPU or CPU).

This document outlines the architecture and expected behavior of the runtime layer, from initial dispatch to wavefunction simulation or QPU execution.

🎮 Execution Model

Task Execution Contexts Issue #201

Q++ defines three runtime task contexts:
	•	task<CPU> → Runs directly on CPU
	•	task<QPU> → Delegated to quantum processing unit
	•	task<AUTO> → Evaluated and dispatched based on scope and data

Runtime determines target execution via scope analysis, bit type resolution, and probabilistic annotations.

Probabilistic Tagging Issue #202

Scopes with quantum conditionals (e.g., if (q[0])) are tagged as probabilistic. These scopes:
	•	Cannot be resolved until measurement or simulation
	•	Must be tracked by the runtime for quantum resolution

Scope Resolution Flow Issue #203
	1.	Parse task and determine execution path
	2.	Check for probabilistic tags
	3.	If none → execute immediately
	4.	If tagged → defer to simulator or QPU

🔄 Simulation Layer

Wavefunction Simulator Issue #204

Used when real QPU is not available or during testing:
	•	Tracks all quantum states
	•	Resolves conditionals using amplitude sampling
	•	Emits measurement collapse when required

Collapse API Issue #205

collapse(q[1]);

	•	Collapses state and resolves all upstream probabilistic scopes
	•	Required to finalize any deferred logic branches

Timeout Conditions Issue #206

Quantum states exceeding coherence time or simulator bounds raise:
	•	EntanglementTimeoutError
	•	UncomputablePathError

⸻

📦 Memory and Bit Models

Bit Inference Model Issue #207
	•	Default: All variables are quantum unless explicitly marked cbits
	•	Quantum and classical bits co-exist in memory but follow different dispatch logic

Register Mapping Issue #208
	•	register resolves to a CPU or QPU memory bank depending on context
	•	Developers may force register type using cregister or qregister

⸻

🔧 Task Scheduling and Dispatch

Hybrid Dispatch Queue Issue #209
	•	AUTO tasks enter a dispatch queue
	•	Runtime analyzes scope, calls, and bit usage
	•	Dispatched to either CPU, simulator, or QPU

Hardware Capabilities Map Issue #210

Defines available QPUs, simulators, and constraints like:
	•	Qubit count
	•	Gate limits
	•	Coherence windows

⸻

🧪 Debugging and Logging

Probabilistic Trace Logging Issue #211
	•	Log probabilistic branches
	•	Output execution paths taken
	•	Show amplitude weights

Scope Map Output Issue #212
	•	Visual output of tasks with color-coded scope states
	•	Indicates resolved, collapsed, deferred states

⸻

📌 Notes for Implementation
	•	Use wavefunction simulation backend for dev
	•	Support backend-agnostic dispatch APIs
	•	Emit IR with @collapse_marker or similar tags for QPU vendors
	•	Final hardware support via IBM Q / Google Cirq APIs
