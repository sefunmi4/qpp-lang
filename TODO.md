# Project TODOs

The following tasks should be completed before sharing the project widely and inviting collaborators:

- Implement a real parser in `qppc` generating an intermediate representation.
- Extend `qpp-run` to execute that IR via the runtime scheduler and memory manager.
- Make `MemoryManager` and `Scheduler` thread-safe and add error reporting.
- Support additional quantum gates and utilities in the `Wavefunction` class.
- Increase the C++ test suite to cover more runtime features and edge cases.
- Document contribution guidelines, code style, and issue templates.
