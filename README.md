# QR: Visual Quantum Programming Language for Ether OS

**QR** is a universal quantum programming language built in Rust. It combines classical (C/C++–like) constructs with cutting-edge quantum operations and integrates innovative gesture/VR input—paving the way for a new coding paradigm. QR is designed as the core language for Ether OS, an operating system featuring classical and quantum capabilities, immersive VR wallpapers, and intuitive trackpad gesture functionality.

## Overview

**QR** is an experimental, next-generation programming language that fuses classical and quantum computing paradigms. Using Rust as its backbone, QR is designed to be:
- **Hardware-Agnostic:** Supporting classical computing patterns and abstracting quantum operations.
- **Innovative:** Featuring gesture-based and VR-integrated coding experiences.
- **Extensible:** Serving as the core language for Ether OS, a visionary operating system with immersive VR wallpapers and interactive features.

Our MVP focuses on delivering core functionality to early adopters including developers, startups, and public quantum hardware companies.

## Project Vision

- **Universal Quantum Programming:** A language that abstracts quantum operations in a vendor-neutral way.
- **Seamless Classical & Quantum Integration:** Providing a C/C++–like experience alongside advanced quantum constructs.
- **Immersive Visual Coding:** Incorporating trackpad gestures and VR interfaces to create a unique coding experience.
- **Ether OS Integration:** Serving as the foundation for Ether OS, a platform that reimagines the operating system experience.
