## Overview

**QR** is an experimental, next-generation programming language that fuses classical and quantum computing paradigms. Using Rust as its backbone, QR is designed to be:
- **Hardware-Agnostic:** Supporting classical computing patterns and abstracting quantum operations.
- **Innovative:** Featuring gesture-based and VR-integrated coding experiences.
- **Extensible:** Serving as the core language for Ether OS, a visionary operating system with immersive VR wallpapers and interactive features.

Our MVP focuses on delivering core functionality to early adopters including developers, startups, and public quantum hardware companies.

## Project Vision

- **Universal Quantum Programming:** A language that abstracts quantum operations in a vendor-neutral way.
- **Seamless Classical & Quantum Integration:** Providing a C/C++–like experience alongside advanced quantum constructs.
- **Immersive Visual Coding:** Incorporating trackpad gestures and VR interfaces to create a unique coding experience.
- **Ether OS Integration:** Serving as the foundation for Ether OS, a platform that reimagines the operating system experience.

## MVP Roadmap

Below is our staged roadmap for delivering the MVP. Each stage represents actionable tasks that will guide the development process.

### Stage 1: Planning and Research

- **Define MVP Goals & Scope**
  - Document the MVP's essential features:
    - Core classical (C/C++–like) constructs.
    - Basic quantum operations (a minimal set of gates, measurements, and wave function manipulation).
    - Initial noise modeling for simulating realistic behavior.
    - Minimal gesture/VR input (support for one or two common gestures mapped to quantum operations).
  - Identify key target audiences (developers, startups, public quantum hardware companies).
  - Create a brief Goals & Scope document focused on MVP requirements.
  
- **Research Existing Ecosystems**
  - Analyze key quantum platforms (e.g., Qiskit, Cirq) for minimal IR and backend interactions.
  - Explore essential Rust libraries for parsing, compiler construction, and gesture recognition.
  - Summarize findings in a research document highlighting critical MVP aspects.

### Stage 2: Language Specification and Design

- **Draft MVP Language Specification Document**
  - Define the minimal syntax and semantics:
    - Basic classical control structures.
    - Minimal quantum operations (e.g., Hadamard, Pauli-X, measurement).
  - Specify how a small subset of gesture inputs (e.g., a swipe or circle) map to quantum operations.
  - Create an initial draft of the specification focusing on MVP features.
  
- **Design a Simplified Hardware-Agnostic IR**
  - Develop a lightweight IR that represents essential classical and quantum constructs.
  - Plan for simple adapters to output one target format (e.g., QASM) for the initial MVP.
  - Document the MVP IR design.

### Stage 3: Compiler Frontend Development

- **Set Up Parsing and Lexing**
  - Choose and integrate a Rust parsing library (e.g., [pest](https://pest.rs) or [nom](https://github.com/Geal/nom)).
  - Implement a basic grammar covering MVP syntax.
  - Write initial tests to validate the parser.
  
- **Build the Core Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**
  - Design an AST structure for the MVP language features.
  - Integrate support for minimal gesture input markers in the AST.
  - Develop unit tests for AST generation.

### Stage 4: Intermediate Representation and Optimization

- **Implement a Basic IR**
  - Translate the MVP AST into a simple IR.
  - Ensure the IR supports core classical and quantum operations.
  - Document the translation process and IR structure.
  
- **Minimal Optimization Passes**
  - Implement basic optimization routines (e.g., inlining simple functions, gate sequence cleanup).
  - Keep noise modeling integration straightforward for MVP.
  - Write tests to validate IR transformations.

### Stage 5: Compiler Backend Development

- **MVP Code Generation**
  - Develop a module to translate the IR into a single target format (e.g., QASM).
  - Implement minimal adapters for a selected quantum hardware backend.
  - Write integration tests for the backend.
  
- **Integrate Basic Noise Modeling**
  - Create a simple noise simulation function that maps ideal operations to noisy counterparts.
  - Validate noise modeling with simulation tests.
  - Document the noise modeling approach.

### Stage 6: Gesture/VR Input Integration

- **MVP Gesture Recognition**
  - Research and choose a lightweight Rust library or API for basic gesture recognition.
  - Implement support for one or two gestures (e.g., swipe up for Hadamard, circle for measurement).
  - Develop a minimal mapping module that translates these gestures into corresponding AST nodes or commands.
  - Prototype visual feedback for gesture recognition in a simple UI or command-line tool.
  - Test gesture integration with sample inputs.

### Stage 7: Testing and Simulation

- **Develop MVP Unit and Integration Tests**
  - Write unit tests for lexer, parser, AST, IR, and backend modules.
  - Develop integration tests covering the end-to-end compilation process.
  - Create tests for the gesture recognition and mapping functionality.
  
- **Quantum Circuit Simulation**
  - Set up a basic simulation environment to run quantum circuits.
  - Incorporate minimal noise modeling into the simulation.
  - Iterate on the simulation based on test results.

### Stage 8: Documentation and Community Engagement

- **Develop MVP Documentation**
  - Write guides on language syntax and core quantum operations.
  - Create quick-start tutorials and sample projects demonstrating MVP functionality.
  - Set up a simple documentation site (e.g., GitHub Pages).
  
- **Community Outreach for MVP**
  - Prepare a public announcement and release notes for the MVP.
  - Establish communication channels (GitHub Discussions, Discord) for early adopters.
  - Schedule regular updates and collect feedback.

### Stage 9: Iterative Improvement and Deployment

- **Release MVP (Alpha/Beta)**
  - Package the MVP with core language features and gesture support.
  - Release the MVP to early adopters and key stakeholders.
  - Collect feedback and log issues for further iterations.
  
- **Plan Post-MVP Iterative Enhancements**
  - Prioritize feedback-driven improvements.
  - Expand gesture support and additional quantum operations.
  - Iterate on IR, backend support, and noise modeling for broader hardware compatibility.
